# Tasks for day 5

## Average height

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

Example Input 1
156 178 165 171 187
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

Example Output 1
total height = 857
number of students = 5
average height = 171
Example Input 2
151 145 179
Example Output 2
total height = 475
number of students = 3
average height = 158

## High score

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x
Example Input
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Example Output
The highest score in the class is: 91

## Adding even numbers

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

Also, we will constrain the inputs to only take numbers from 0 to a max of 1000.

Example Input 1
10
Example Output 1
30
Example Input 2
52
Example Output 2
702

## FizzBuzz

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

e.g. it might start off like this:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
