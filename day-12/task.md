# Tasks for day 12

## Numbers guessing game

- Include an ASCII art logo.
- Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
- Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer.
- If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
- Track the number of turns remaining.
- If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player.
- Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).

### Notes on the task

- In all other tasks I had defined functions and worked with those. This time I thought is it even worth doing it.
- Defining variables in block scope is a strange feeling.
- Also it is quite cool using copilot for small logic. It increases development speed by a lot.
- Funny that the solution provided by the tutor has a game function that is defined and then run. I guess it is truly the preferred way to do so.
