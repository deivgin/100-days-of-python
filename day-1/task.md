# Task

## Console

Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console. The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code. Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below.

1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
3. Add 3g of Salt.
4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.

## Debugging

Look at the code in the code editor on the left. There are errors on all 4 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

```python
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

## Input function

Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name. Your code should only output the number, no other text is needed.

## Variables

This program takes two inputs. The first input is stored in a variable called a. The second input is stored in a variable called b.

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

Example Input 1

Example Output 1
a: 41
