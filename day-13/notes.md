# notes for day 13

Day for learning debugging.

Some suggestions:

1. describe the problem
2. reproduce the bug
3. play computer
4. fix the errors
5. use print
6. use a debugger
7. take a break
8. ask a friend
9. run often
10. ask stack overflow

My thoughts on these:

It is interesting listening to these examples, that I have been using quite a bit as a professional. But as primarily a FE developer I have been stuck using log statements to debug my code. It is rare for me to use the debugger, which in back end development is essential I guess. Well in the future with more complex python code perhaps I will get the chance to try using it more.

On the topic of "asking stack overflow" I feel like it is dead in 2024. Like most questions that are simple and common have been answered and if you have a really specific problem it is hard for them to answer. By far I have never asked or fel the need to do so.
